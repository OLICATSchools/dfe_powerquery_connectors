## GIAS Data

This script gets the most up to date snapshot of information stored on Get Information About Schools. Snapshots are accessed using a combination of year, month and day values. This script polls the system it's running on for current data information to ensure the most recent snapshot is accessed.

## PerformanceTables Data

This script gets the most up to date snapshot of information stored in the Compare School Performance Tables. Whereas the GIAS service provides a single dataset of basic details on every school, the Performance Tables have a variety of different datasets available.

By default the script downloads the Spring Census summary data for the most recently published Performance Tables. Changing the CENSUS keyword for one of those listed below will download a different dataset:

  Keyword | Description

  SPINE | Spine (general school information)
  KS2 | Final Key Stage 2 headline results
  KS4 | Final Key Stage 4 headline results
  KS4PROV | Provisional Key Stage 4 headline results

  KS5 | Final Key Stage 5 headline results
  KS5UNDERLYING | Key Stage 5 qualification and subject level data  
  VAQUAL | Key Stage 5 value added qualification level data
  VASUBJ | Key Stage 5 value added subject level data 
  KS5APPR | Apprenticeships data

Like the GIAS Data script, this script accesses snapshots using a combination of date information. In this case the starting and ending years of an academic year separated by a "-". 

Unlike the GIAS dataset, different parts of the Performance Tables are released at different times. To ensure the most up to date information is captured the script will look for datasets linked to the previous academic year first. If no data is yet available for the previous year, the script will collect the most recent available dataset.
