# PowerQuery for Department for Education data sources

This repository contains PowerQuery scripts for connecting to various publicly available Department for Education datasets. The author accepts no liability for their use and cannot guarantee they will continue to work should the Department for Education make changes to either of it's publicly available data systems.

PowerQuery can be used in both PowerBI and Excel to connect to and manipulate data sources. Using PowerQuery to connect to and shape a dataset can remove the need for the same processes to be applied manually when the data source is updated.

Thanks goes to [Scott (@fusionet24)](https://twitter.com/fusionet24) for his work on a similar project in R which inspired these scripts, to the EduData community for their insight and to the Department for Education for making these datasets readily available to datanauts like us.

## Connectors

These are PowerQuery scripts that will draw down data sources from Department for Education systems, including the Get Information About Schools service and the Compare School Performance service

## Functions

These are helper functions that can supplement existing datasets, for example the IMD lookup function
